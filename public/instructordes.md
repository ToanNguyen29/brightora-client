I'm **Angela**, I'm a developer with a passion for teaching. I'm the lead instructor at the _London App Brewery_, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as _Twitter_, _Facebook_, and _Google_ to teach their employees.

My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own _Space Invader_ game. Since then, I've made hundreds of websites, apps, and games. But most importantly, I realized that my greatest passion is **teaching**.

I spend most of my time researching how to make learning to code fun and make hard concepts easy to understand. I apply everything I discover into my bootcamp courses. In my courses, you'll find lots of geeky humor but also lots of explanations and animations to make sure everything is easy to understand.

I'll be there for you every step of the way.
